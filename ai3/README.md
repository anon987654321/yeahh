AI^3 includes and supports:
- **Calculator**: Perform complex calculations on demand.
- **File Search**: Efficiently search and retrieve files.
- **Weather Tool**: Fetch and present real-time weather information.
- **Universal Scraper**: Smart human-like scraping with Ferrum.

### 4. Secure Execution
Implements OpenBSD's `pledge` and `unveil` for secure and isolated runtime environments.

### 5. Context-Aware Memory
Maintains interaction history to enable coherent and continuous workflows, adapting seamlessly to user needs.

### 6. CLI and PWA Integration
A robust CLI and mobile-first Rails PWA ensure accessibility and functionality across platforms, enabling users to harness AI^3's capabilities on both Unix systems and mobile devices.
