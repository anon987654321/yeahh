## Most Detailed Human Simulation: Leveraging hAPI's Public Healthcare Unified Integration (PHUI)

### Vision:

The goal is to create a detailed 3D human model simulation in a virtual environment, capturing intricacies down to the molecular and possibly atomic level. This project aims to create a space that replicates known physical laws for rigorous scientific experimentation and discovery. The project uses Ruby and Mittsu, providing a unique approach compared to existing specialized molecular biology software.

### Unique Approach:

This project uses Ruby methods as modular building blocks for constructing and simulating molecular models. This modular approach allows for a clean, organized codebase that can be easily extended and integrated.

### Why Ruby and Mittsu?

Standard 3D engines like Blender are not designed to handle the extreme scales involved in molecular or atomic models. Ruby and Mittsu offer the flexibility for custom scaling and rendering solutions, allowing the project to address challenges that are difficult to solve using traditional 3D engines.

### Objective:

The aim is to use Artificial Intelligence to perform extensive, multifaceted tests on this human model. By using Ruby methods as building blocks, the project aims to push scientific boundaries, providing a new platform for research and discoveries.
